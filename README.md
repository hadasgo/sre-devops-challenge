# Objectives
Setup a CI flow for an open source project - it can be in any program language, but must have some level of unit testing (we can provide an example if needed).
Build & Deploy a service as a Docker container activity
High level guidance
Create / Clone an existing project on Github - please choose an existing open source project which doesnâ€™t have a Docker distro already, alternatively improve an existing one (and explain why in your project's README.md)
Containerize your service
Setup or Use CI-service (e.g travis-ci/jenkins)
Supply a deploy directory which includes some configuration management tool.
Deployment tool - which deploys your docker container on a docker enabled host.
Compose a succinct README.md which will enable any customer to follow a step by step explanation from the git clone until the running sample.
In the README file, please note 3 things you would improve in your submission.
Clarifications
Deliverable will be in a form of a PR (1 or more) + access to CI process/server

Any manual instructions should be supplied as part of the PR in a form of README.md
